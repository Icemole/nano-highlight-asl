The utility that nobody asked for.

Highlight code from .asl (AgentSpeak Language) when using the nano editor.

## How to enable it?
- Step 1: download the file and save it on your least preferred directory.
- Step 2: depending on whether you want to enable it globally or locally, go to `/etc/nanorc` or `~/.config/nano/nanorc`, respectively. When editing it (using nano, of course), add the line `include <path-to-least-preferred-directory>/jason.nanorc`. For more information, go to <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Nano">the ArchWiki's page on nano</a> whose content I shamelessly stole.
- Step 3: you are now ready to write code on everyone's most favourite editor to get those agents running!
